# Chicken Fortress 3

this is an edited version of Chicken Fortress 3.

installation same as original

note for anyone compiling this one: for some reason all the dlls that arent client.dll or mp.dll have bugs that crash the game when opened. I don't know if it's just on my end or not, but this happens even if i grab the source code directly from the normal CKF3Alpha. I suggest just sticking with client / mp changes for now until someone fixes this
